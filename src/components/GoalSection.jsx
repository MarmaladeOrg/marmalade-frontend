              The Marmalade Jam C application aims to revolutionize the blockchain<br />
              <span className="line-number">2 </span>
              ecosystem by providing a <span className="highlight">high-performance</span>,<br />
              <span className="line-number">3 </span>
              <span className="highlight">secure</span>, and <span className="highlight">efficient</span> solution tailored for decentralized<br />
              <span className="line-number">4 </span>
              applications. Leveraging the unique <span className="highlight">in-core/on-chain dualism</span><br />
              <span className="line-number">5 </span>
              architecture described in section 3.1 of the Jam graypaper, Marmalade<br />
              <span className="line-number">6 </span>
              maximizes throughput and minimizes latency, ensuring robust and<br />
              <span className="line-number">7 </span>
              scalable performance.<br />
              <span className="line-number">8 </span>
              Our primary objective is to create a seamless integration of advanced<br />
              <span className="line-number">9 </span>
              blockchain technology with real-world applications, facilitating the growth<br />
              <span className="line-number">10 </span>
              and adoption of decentralized systems. Marmalade's C implementation offers<br />
              <span className="line-number">11 </span>
              <span className="highlight">low-level control</span> over system resources, resulting in optimized performance that<br />
              <span className="line-number">12 </span>
              can handle high transaction volumes with ease, as detailed in section 4.2 of<br />
              <span className="line-number">13 </span>
              the Jam graypaper.<br />
              <span className="line-number">14 </span>
              <span className="highlight">Security</span> is at the forefront of our design philosophy. By incorporating advanced<br />
              <span className="line-number">15 </span>
              crypto-economic mechanisms, Marmalade ensures the correctness and<br />
              <span className="line-number">16 </span>
              availability of computations, maintaining system integrity even in the<br />
              <span className="line-number">17 </span>
              presence of adversarial actions. This robust security framework, highlighted<br />
              <span className="line-number">18 </span>
              in section 5.3 of the Jam graypaper, is crucial for fostering trust and<br />
              <span className="line-number">19 </span>
              reliability in the blockchain network.<br />
              <span className="line-number">20 </span>
              <span className="highlight">Scalability</span> is another key focus. With the ability to efficiently process transactions<br />
              <span className="line-number">21 </span>
              and manage a growing state-space, Marmalade is designed to support the<br />
              <span className="line-number">22 </span>
              expanding needs of modern decentralized applications. Our approach allows<br />
              <span className="line-number">23 </span>
              for temporary fragmentation of the state to handle processing tasks,<br />
              <span className="line-number">24 </span>
              maintaining overall coherency and performance, as explained in section<br />
              <span className="line-number">25 </span>
              6.1 of the Jam graypaper.<br />
              <span className="line-number">26 </span>
              Furthermore, Marmalade emphasizes <span className="highlight">accessibility</span> and <span className="highlight">ease of use</span>. By providing<br />
              <span className="line-number">27 </span>
              a clear and comprehensive API, along with thorough documentation, we aim<br />
              <span className="line-number">28 </span>
              to lower the barrier to entry for developers and innovators. Our goal is to<br />
              <span className="line-number">29 </span>
              enable a wide range of participants to contribute to and benefit from the<br />
              <span className="line-number">30 </span>
              blockchain ecosystem, fostering a vibrant and dynamic community. Refer to<br />
